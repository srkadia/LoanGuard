# LoanGuard: AI-Powered Loan Default Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
LoanGuard is an end-to-end **machine learning application** designed to predict loan defaulters using **Lending Club loan data**. The system is built using Python for data processing, ML modeling, and a REST API, while a React.js frontend provides a user-friendly interface. The project is **fully deployable** and follows industry best practices.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Predict Loan Default Risk**: Users can enter loan details and get real-time predictions.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Uses advanced classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Frontend UI**: Interactive React-based dashboard for input and results visualization.
- **API Integration**: FastAPI/Flask-based backend serves predictions via REST API.
- **Deployment Ready**: Docker, Heroku, AWS/GCP deployment options.

## 📊 Dataset Details
- **Source**: Lending Club Loan Dataset (from Kaggle/UCI Repository)
- **Target Variable**: `loan_status` (Default or Not Default)
- **Key Features**:
  - Loan amount, interest rate, employment length
  - Annual income, debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
  - Credit history, late payments, open credit lines
